          Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax used on the supply of goods and services.
          GST is a value-added tax levied on goods and services sold for domestic consumption.
          It has subsumed several taxes including central excise duty, services tax, additional customs duty, surcharges and
          state-level value added tax. The GST is paid by consumers, but it is remitted to the government by the businesses
          selling the goods and services. GST provides revenue for the government and the Goods and Service Tax Act was passed
          in the Parliament in March 2017 and came into effect on July 2017. The three types of GST are Central Goods and Service
          Tax, State Goods and Service Tax, Integrated Goods and Service Tax. Since its instruction, GST has undergone many changes
          and is spearheaded by the GST Council, which has 34 members (primarily finance minister from each state) and headed by the
          on Finance Minister. The Council meets on a regular basis for revisions, clarifications, additions and enactments of rule or
          rate changes of the goods and services in India. <br />
