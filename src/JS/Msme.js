                            <span className="msme__answer">Aadhaar Card is that the only document required for MSME registration. MSME registration is fully 
                            online and no proof of documents is required. PAN and GST linked details on investment and turnover of enterprises are going to be taken automatically by the Udyam Registration Portal from the govt databases. The Udyam Registration Portal is fully integrated with tax and GSTIN systems. PAN and GSTIN number is mandatory from 01.04.2021 for registration. Registration without PAN and GSTIN are often done now but need to be updated with PAN number and GSTIN number within 01/04/2021 for avoiding suspension of registration. Those who have EM-II or UAM registration or the other registration issued by any authority under the Ministry of MSME,
                            will need to re-register themselves during this Portal (as stated in the Registration Process heading above)</span>
